# Mapping HPS Peripherals, like I²C or CAN, over the FPGA fabric to FPGA I/O and using embedded Linux to control them

![Alt text](doc/conceptHeader.jpg?raw=true "Concept Overview")

Development Boards for Intel SoC-FPGA allow often only a simple access to FPGA I/O-Pins. 
The only way to use HPS-Hard-IP Interfaces with these boards is the routing over the FPGA fabric.

For example, the **Terasic DE10-Nano** development Board with an **Intel Cyclone V SoC-FPGA** has an Arduino UNO compatible socket. 
This is a nice feature, because it is possible to use nearly any Arduino Shield from the huge *Arduino* community with SoC-FPGA’s. 
Here are also all digital Pins connected to FPGA I/O Pins. 
With the Intel *NIOSII*-Softcore processor and some Soft-IP it is not too complicated to interact with these shields. 
But if the target applications require the connection of the capabilities of an embedded Linux system, running on the HPS, 
it will be. One reason is, that I only could find one official guide ([AN 706](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/an/an706.pdf)), 
with a *golden reference* design witch shows only a chapter of the development process.

**With this following step by step guide I will give a complete description and I will also shown as an example, 
how to transmit CAN-Bus Packages with a simple Linux Python script running on an embadded Linux by using an Arduino Shield with the Terasic DE10-Nano board.**

This project is a part of my [*rsYocto* embedded Linux system](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto), 
that I developed during my master study and I use it here as a reference.

**Note: This project is a bit out of date.... I completely redesigned the [*rsyocto* build system](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto/blob/rsYocto-1.042/doc/guides/7_customVersions.md) (part 2-6). Please follow Part 1 and consider my [custom *rsyocto* version guide](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto/blob/rsYocto-1.042/doc/guides/7_customVersions.md). Then you can continue with part 5 to create your Device Tree and with part 7+.  In the future I will update this guide... Many Thanks.**

**The build flow of rsYocto shows the interaction of all required parts.**

# 1. Part: Creating the FPGA configuration
The first part of this project is the creation of a **Quartus Prime FPGA project** to configure the **ARM Cortex A9 Hard Processor System (HPS)** and the routing of HPS Bus Interfaces through the FPGA fabric. At the end will be the generation of a FPGA configuration file, that can be loaded by the secondary bootloader as shown in the next parts.

* Use **Terasic’s System Builder** to generate a new  **Intel Quartus Prime project** with the right I/O-Pin mapping
* Open this Quartus Prime Project and **create a new Platform Designer model**
* Insert the component “**Arria V/Cyclone V Hard Processor System**” to this model
* It should look like this:
	![Alt text](doc/docPic_01.jpg?raw=true "Picture 01")
	
* Note: Do not change the name “*hps_0*”!  With a different name some errors could occure in the device tree building process of the Linux system

### HPS component configuration 

* Open the **HPS component Editor** and select the “**FPGA Interfaces**”-Tab
* Here you can configure the system on your own wishes
* It makes sense to enable all AXI Bridges, they are not required for this project, but if a Linux application tries to access on a disabled bridge address a Linux Kernel panic will be occured.
* I choose the following configuration:

	![Alt text](doc/docPic_02.jpg?raw=true "Picture 02")
	
* Special Resets-, Interrupts- or DMA-Settings are not required
* Continue with the “**Peripheral Pins**”-Tab
* For the usage of DE10-Nano`s HPS components choose the following settings:

	| **Peripheral Name** | **Status** | **Addional Settings**
	|:--|:--|:--|
	| Ethernet Media Access Controller 1 (**EMAC1**) | *HPS I/O Set 0* | *EMAC1 mode: "RGMII"*
	| SD/MMC Controller (**SDIO**) | *HPS I/O Set 0* | *SDIO mode ="4-bit Data"*
	|USB Controller 1 (**USB1**) | *HPS I/O Set 0* | *USB1 PHY interface mode="SDR with PHY clock output mode"*
	| UART Controller 0 (**UART0**) | *HPS I/O Set 0* | *UART0 mode="No Flow Control"*
	| I2C Controller 0 (**I2C0**) | *HPS I/O Set 0* | *I2C0 mode="I2C"*
* This gives the Linux system **SDMMC** as boot source
* To map the **I²C-, SPI- , UART- and CAN-Bus* to the Arduino interface** by selecting these points addionaly:

	| **Peripheral Name** | **Status** | **Addional Settings**
	|:--|:--|:--|
	| UART Controller 1 (**UART1**) | *FPGA* | *UART0 mode="Full"*
	| I2C Controller 1 (**I2C1**) | *FPGA* | *I2C1 mode="I2C"*
	| SPI Controller 0 (**SPI0**) | *FPGA* | *SPI0 mode="Master"*
	| CAN Controller 0 (**CAN0**) | *FPGA* | *-*
	
* Open the “**SDRAM**”-Tab 
  (Do not change the settings of the "HPS-Cock"-Tab)
* In my GitHub repository is the **.qprs**-memory configuration file "D10STDNANO_DDR3.qprs" included
* Copy this file to your Quartus Prime project folder and click inside the **HPS component editor** and **presents**-bar the "**new**"-button

    ![Alt text](doc/docPic_05.jpg?raw=true "Picture 05")
    
* A **new preset window** appears, select the **.qprs**-file and name it.

     ![Alt text](doc/docPic_06.jpg?raw=true "Picture 06")
     
* Again, close the preset window, select in the list the previously imported preset and click apply to execute the configuration
* At this point HPS configuration is done (Press **Finish** to close the window)

### HPS interconnection
 * The only necessary connection to use the HPS is: **clk_0:clk_in_reset --> hps_0:h2f_cold_reset**
 * Export the **SPI-, UART- ,I2C-, CAN-, memory** and **hps_IO** by double clicking on the *export text file*
 
 	![Alt text](doc/docPic_07.jpg?raw=true "Picture 07")
	
* Additionally connect **PIO (Parallel I/O) Intel FPGA IP**-modules to a **HPS-to-FPGA interface** to LEDs or key-switches
	
	![Alt text](doc/docPic_08.jpg?raw=true "Picture 08")
	 
* Generate with "**System/Assign Base Addresses**" memory addresses of the HPS Bridge interfaces
* Finally press the "**Generate HDL...**"-button to build the final platform

### Import the HPS Platform to Quartus Prime
 * Add the "*.qip*"- and the "*.sip*" from the Platform Designer to the project files 
 * Use following Verilog code inside the **top level file** to import this HPS-model:

	*  In case of **Error 14566**: "*The Fitter cannot place 1 periphery component(s) due to conflicts with existing constraints*"
		  * Run following TCL Command: 
			````shell
			set_global_assignment -name AUTO_RESERVE_CLKUSR_FOR_CALIBRATION OF
			````
	 *   To use FPGA I/O-Pins with the HPS is a FPGA configuration necessary
	 * Both possible ways requiere different  "*.raw*"-files
		 * For **configuration during the Boot with u-boot** use these export settings:
			-   Type: `Raw Binary File (.rbf)`
			-   Mode: `Passive Paralle x8`       
		 * For **configuration of the FPGA with Linux** use these export settings:
			-   Type: `Raw Binary File (.rbf)`
			-   Mode: `Passive Paralle x16`       
	*  Use the export function of Quartus prime to generate these two files
	*  For more informations look [here](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto/blob/master/doc/guides/6_newFPGAconf.md)

Now the configuration of the FPGA fabric is done. But to load this configuration and interact with it two different boodloaders and a embedded Linux system must be built. To help to simplify this huge development effort I designed for my own open *rsYocto* a building system. All components are pre-built and can by changed randomly later on. Internally the Altera `make_sdimage.py` script is called to put all components together and to build the final image. 

You can use the *rsYocto-Building script* with all components included. Then you only need to replace the files you want to change. To include the previously built FPGA configuration files with the `socfpga_nano.rbf`file (*FPGA configuration file written by the secondary bootloader*) and optionally the`socfpga_nano_linux.rbf`file (*FPGA configuration file can by written by Linux*) with your files. The using of this building system is described and availible on the [*rsYocto*-Github repository](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto) in [**Step by step guide 5**](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto/blob/master/doc/guides/6_newFPGAconf.md).

In the next parts I show the building process in details. You can skip this guide and use the final *SD-folder* with all necessary components included.


# 2. Part: Building of the primary bootloader with Intel EDS

The job of the primary bootloader is the configuration of the HPS and the enabling of all choosen Hard-IP components. During the boot of this bootloader the SDRAM-memory system starts and the secondary bootloader (**u-boot**) is loaded. 
For the Building of this bootloader Intel provides within EDS a tool called "**BSP-Editor**".  
The following illustration shows the **Intel EDS BSP Generator Flow for Cyclone V FPGAs**:
![Alt text](doc/BSPbuildFlow.jpg?raw=true "BSP Build Flow picture")

### Installation of Intel EDS
The **Intel Embedded Development Suite (EDS)** works with Windows and Linux. I prefere **Ubuntu** Linux running as a Virtual Machine.

*  **Download Intel FPGA SoC EDS for Linux**
	*  [Download Link](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/soceds/18.1/?edition=standard&platform=linux&download_manager=direct)
	* For this tutorial the **EDS Version 18** is used
* **Install Intel EDS**
	* Run following Linux shell command to start the installer
		````bash
		chmod +x SoCEDSSetup-18.X.X.XXX-linux.run
		sudo ./SoCEDSSetup-18.X.X.XXX-linux.run
		````
	* At the end of the installation process uncheck: “*Launch DS-5 installation*”, 
	
		![Alt text](doc/EDSinstall.jpg?raw=true "EDS Installer screenshoot")

### Generation of the primary bootloader with Intel EDS
* **Start with this command the Intel EDS shell:**
	 ````bash
		 cd ~/intelFPGA/18.1/embedded
		 sudo ./embedded_comand_shell.sh
	 ````
* Use the next EDS Shell command to **start Intel EDS BSP-Editor**
	````bash
	 (EDS shell)# bsp-editor
	 ````
* The BSP Editor automatically imports all configurations from the Quartus Prime IDE
* All possible settings are documented inside [Intel’s EDS Development Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/ug/ug_soc_eds.pdf) 
* Create a **new BSP project** by navigating inside the BSP Editor to: "**File / New HPS BSP...**"
* Select inside the appearing window the **Quartus Prime Handoff Folder** "**.xml**"-file 
* Choose as the “Preloader setting directory” the Platform Designer "**hps_isw_handoff**"-Folder inside of the Quartus Prime folder
* Press "**OK**" to close the "*new BSP*"-window
* **Modify the prealoader settings**:
	* Choose SDMMC for the SD-Card as boot source by checking *BOOT_FROM_SDMMC* at following position:
		* **spl --> boot --> BOOT_FROM_SDMMC**
	* **Enable the FAT-filesystem support**:
		* **spl --> boot --> FAT_SUPPORT**
		
			![Alt text](doc/BSPeditor.jpg?raw=true "BSP Editor picture")

	* Press inside the main BSP-Editor window the "**Generat**e" button 
	* The application generates all necessary code files for the primary bootloader
	* Close the BSP Editor
	
### Compiling the primary bootloader with Intel EDS 
The BSP-Editor puts the generated primary bootloader code to the **folder "software" inside the Quartus Prime Project folder**.
* Navigate with the EDS shell to this folder:
	````bash
	cd <Qurtus Prime project> /software/spl_bsp
	````
* Build the code:
	````bash
	(EDS shell)# make
	````
	* **Note:** Be sure that this command was called inside the **Intel EDS command shell**!
* The compiler should output after a successfull build a file called "**preloader-mkimage.bin**"
* This file contains the executable bootloader and must be pre installed on the boot SD-card later
	
			 
# 3. Part:  Development of the secondary bootloader (u-boot)
The primary bootloader starts the **secondary bootloader (u-boot)**. His job is to enable the **HPS to FPGA bridges**, to **pre-configre the FPGA fabric** and to **load Linux** then. 
A final working u-boot executable is availible inside the SD-folder on the [*rsYocto*-Github repository](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto). 
The important part of the u-boot bootloader is the execution of a **bootloader script**. This feature is inside this u-boot version pre-enabled. 

### **Building of a secoundary bootloader script:**
* Create a new file: "**uboot_cy5.script**"
* Insert following lines to the script and modify it on your own.

	````console
	#

	run mmcboot;

	````
 * Run with the **EDS shell** following command to **build this script**:
	 ````bash
	 mkimage –A arm – O linux –T script –C none –a 0 –e 0 \
	-n u-boot –d uboot_cy5.script \
	uboot_cy5.script.scr
	````
* *Mkimage* generates the compiled script file: "**uboot_cy5.script.scr**"
* Replace this file inside the ***rsYocto* SD-folder** 

# 4. Part:  Using the Yocto project to build a custom embedded Linux

Inside my designed [`meta-intelfpga` BSP layer](https://github.com/robseb/meta-intelfpga) I **describe in details how to get started with the Yocto project for Intel SoC-FPGAs**. 

Also I published a [Yocto project meta layer](https://github.com/robseb/meta-rstools) to **bring tools to update the FPGA configuration with the running Linux and to interact with simple command with the FPGA fabric**. 

Please follow these guides to build your own embedded Linux or overjump this point by using the finished *rsYocto*. 

# 5. Part:  Building the Device Tree for the embedded Linux

During the boot of Linux the **Devices Tree is loaded**. It contains system specific informations about the drivers to load. 
It is possible to use the Yocto project to build the device tree as well. I recommend the usage of my handmade published device tree.
**To enable the loading of other drivers for Hard-IP components, like I2C- or CAN-bus, use following lines**: 
*  **UART1:**
	````dts
	serial1@ffc03000 { // Base address 
		compatible = "snps,dw-apb-uart-16.1", "snps,dw-apb-uart"; // Drivers to load
		reg = <0xffc03000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0xa3 0x4>;
		reg-shift = <0x2>;
		reg-io-width = <0x4>;
		clocks = <0x29>;
		dmas = <0x34 0x1e 0x34 0x1f>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
		phandle = <0x63>;
		status = "okay"; // Enable this device
	};
	````
* **I2C1:**
	````dts 
	i2c@ffc05000 {
		#address-cells = <0x1>;
		#size-cells = <0x0>;
		compatible = "snps,designware-i2c"; // Driver to load
		reg = <0xffc05000 0x1000>;
		resets = <0x24 0x2d>;
		clocks = <0x29>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0x9f 0x4>;
		status = "okay";  // Enable this device
		clock-frequency = <0x61a80>; // Imported: I2C default freq.= 400kHz
		phandle = <0x54>;
	};
	````
*  **SPI1:**
	````dts
	spi@fff00000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-spi-mmio-16.1", "snps,dw-spi-mmio", "snps,dw-apb-ssi";
		#address-cells = <0x1>;
		#size-cells = <0x0>;
		reg = <0xfff00000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0x9a 0x4>;
		num-cs = <0x4>;
		clocks = <0x32>;
		status = "okay";
		phandle = <0x5c>;
	};
	````
*  **CAN0:**
	````dts
	can@ffc00000 {
		compatible = "bosch,dcan-16.1", "bosch,d_can";
		reg = <0xffc00000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0x83 0x4 0x0 0x84 0x4 0x0 0x85 0x4 0x0 0x86 0x4>;
		clocks = <0x7>;
		status = "okay";
		phandle = <0x3a>;
		};
	````
* **Note:** All in *ALTERA linux-socfpga* included drivers are [here documentated](https://github.com/altera-opensource/linux-socfpga/tree/14c741de93861749dfb60b4964028541f5c506ca/Documentation/devicetree/bindings)

# 6. Part:  Generating a bootable Linux image

At this point all required files are together. Now a bootable image file with three different partitions embedded must be built.
The *rsYocto*-Building can generate this system with a single command.
Please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto/blob/master/doc/guides/6_newFPGAconf.md) how to download 
and use the *rsYocto*-SD folder.  

The next table shows the requiered partitions with their content for this project.

| **File name** | **Part of Creation in this guide** | **Description** | **Disk Partition**
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|\"makersYoctoSDImage.py\"| **-** | the automatic *rsYocto* script | **-** |
|\"make_sdimage.py\"| **-** | Altera SD image making script | **-**  | 
|\"infoRSyocto.txt\"| **-**  | rsYocto splech screen Infos | **-**  | 
|\"network_interfaces.txt\"| **6**  | The Linux Network Interface configuration file (/etc/network/interfaces) | **-**  | 
| \"rootfs_cy5.tar.gz\"|**4**|compresed rootFs file for Cyclone V  | **2.Partition: ext3** |       
|\"preloader_cy5.bin\"|**2**| prestage bootloader | **1.Partition: RAW** | 
|\"uboot_cy5.img\"|**-**| Uboot bootloader | **2.Partition: vfat** |       
|\"uboot_cy5.scr\"|**3** | Uboot bootloader script | **3.Partition: vfat** |   
|\"zImage_cy5\"|**4** | compressed Linux Kernel  | **3.Partition: vfat** |   
|\"socfpga_cy5.dts\"|**-** | Linux Device Tree  | **3.Partition: vfat** |   
|\"socfpga_nano.rbf\"|**1**| FPGA configuration file written by u-boot| **2.Partition: ext3** |  
|\"socfpga_nano_linux.rbf\"|**1**| FPGA Configuration that can be written by Linux   | **2.Partition: ext3** |          

* **Enable the CAN Network interface**
  * Create the new file: "*network_interfaces.txt*"
  * This file contains the Linux Network configuration (*/etc/network/interfaces*)
  * To enable *Ethernet 0* with dynamic iPv4-address request add following lines to this file:
    ````txt
    # Ethernet 0
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp
    ````
  * A Loopback is also necessary:
    ````txt
    # The loopback interface
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
    ````
  * The following instructions enable **CAN 0 Network interface**:
    ````txt
    # CAN Bus interface
    # Enable CAN0 with 125kBit/s
    auto can0 
    iface can0 inet manual
	  pre-up /sbin/ip link set can0 type can bitrate 125000 on
	  up /sbin/ifconfig can0 up
	 down /sbin/ifconfig can0 down
    ````
  * Save and close the file 
  * The Building script copy that file to the rootFs (*/etc/network/interfaces*)

* **Files from other boards and platforms can be deleted. Replace selfcreated files.**
The folder should now look like this: 

	![Alt text](doc/docPic_09.jpg?raw=true "Picture 09")

Use following command on a **CentOS-Linux computer** to start the **building script**:
````bash
sudo python makersYoctoSDImage.py   
````
The script will be generated a "**.img**"-file. It can be deployed to **any SD-Card**.

# 7. Part:  Flashing the image to a SD Card and booting Linux 
To install the embedded Linux image file to a bootable SD-card following [these instructions](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto/blob/master/doc/guides/1_Booting.md).
This guide shows how to setup a Terasic DE10-Nano board.


# 8. Part: Unsing the `i2c-tools` and `minicom` to interact with Adrunio shilds
The **Arduino shield header** has a "**SDA**"- and "**SCL**"- pin for the **I2C-Bus**. In Part 1 the Hard-IP I2C-Controller 1 
was connected to these FPGA I/O-Pins. Also here a Serial Port, a SPI master and a CAN Channel are connected. 
On *rsYocto* the `i2c-tools` are pre-installed: follow [these instructions](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto/blob/master/doc/guides/2_FPGA_HARDIP.md) 

# 9. Part: Writing a python script to transmit CAN-packages
In this part shown how simple it is to transmit CAN-packages within a Python script with embedded Linux. 
* To **start the CAN0** execute this command on *rsYocto* to **enable the CAN network Port**:
  ````bash 
  ip link set can0 type can bitrate 125000
  ip link set up can0
  ````
* Install `python-can` with python pip on the running *rsYocto*
  ````bash
  pip install python-can
  ````
 Use *Visual Studio Code Insider* to **debug** this *python-can* application remotely (see [here](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto/blob/master/doc/guides/4_Python.md)). 
 Or to use the onboard `nano`editor to write the python code.
 
 * Create a new Python file, for example:
   ````bash
   nano sendCanPackage.py
   ````
  * Insert following lines to this python file as shown in the [python-can documentation](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
	````python
	#!/usr/bin/env python
	# coding: utf-8

	#
	#This example shows how sending a single message works.
	#

	import can

	def send_one():

		# this uses the default configuration (for example from the config file)
		# see https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html

		# Using specific buses works similar:
		bus = can.interface.Bus(bustype='socketcan', channel='can0', bitrate=12500)
		# ...

		msg = can.Message(arbitration_id=0xAC,
			  data=[0xAB, 0xAC, 0xAD, 0xAE],
			  is_extended_id=False)

		try:
			bus.send(msg)
			print("Message sent on {}".format(bus.channel_info))
		except can.CanError:
			print("Message NOT sent")


	if __name__ == '__main__':
		send_one()
	````
  * Save and close this python file or **start a debugging session** with *Visual Studio Code Insider*
  * Connect to the **Adrunio Pin D8** to **CAN TX** and the Pin **D9** to **CAN RX** on a 3.3V Can-Bus Transiver
  * **Execute the python script**
    ```python 
    python3 sendCanPackage.py
    ````
  * **Debugging of this code with *Visual Studio Code Insider***
  
  	![Alt text](doc/CANdebugging.jpg?raw=true "visual Studio Code debuging")
   
    
  * Now the Cyclone V SoC-FPGA **transmits a CAN package through the Arduino header with the ID 0xAC and the Payload 0xABACADAE**:
  	````bash
	root@cyclone5:~# python3 sendCanPackage.py
	Message sent on socketcan channel 'can0'
	````
	
  	![Alt text](doc/CANoszigram.png?raw=true "CAN Osci")

If no one acknowledged this package the *Bosch CAN-Controller* *re-transmit* the package with the maximum available resources automatically until a ACK happen.
The embedded *Bosch CAN-Controller* can also **detect linkage errors**. 
In case of a missing connection to a CAN-Bus member a Kernel Message will be triggered and the **CAN Controller shuts down**.
Use the following command to **restart the CAN-Controller**:
````bash 
link set down can0
ip link set up can0
````
<br>

**In the same way it is also possible to communicate with Adrunio Shields via UART,SPI or I²C. 
On *rsYocto* python scripts for these usecases are preinstalled.** 
  
With the *remote development* of *Visual Studio* it is also possible to write **C++ -applications** to interact with these buses ([see here](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto/blob/master/doc/guides/3_CPP.md)).

To **read and write the AXI Bridge** or **write the FPGA configuration with the running Linux** please look [here](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto/blob/master/doc/guides/2_FPGA_HARDIP.md).
